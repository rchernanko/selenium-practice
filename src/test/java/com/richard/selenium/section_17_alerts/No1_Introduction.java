/*

- People sometimes get confused by what an alert actually is. An alert is something that is triggered by JavaScript alert code, for example:

alert('hello there');
prompt('this is a prompt')

- An alert is NOT a modal / lightbox. Sometimes people tend to get confused with these 2 very separate things

Handling alerts:

driver.switchTo().alert()...

this switches you from the main window to the alert. .alert() returns an Alert object, which you can then do the following with:

- .getText()
- .dismiss()
- .accept()
- .sendKeys(String)

Is pretty straightforward.
