    In the last section (and another before), we have been using the "out of the box" ExpectedConditions when using
    WebDriverWait...

    In this section, we will learn to create our own, custom expected conditions...

    Why? When would I do this?

    - ExpectedConditions doesn't have what you need
    - You want to make your tests read well for your usage scenario
    - You want to pass additional values to the apply method...

    So, let's create a Custom ExpectedCondition :-)

    Few ways to do this - we will look at the pros and cons:

    1) A separate named class
    2) An anonymous class
    3) An anonymous class wrapped within a method

    So let's move on to the next classes to see examples of these...
