    Abstraction layers / Page Objects are massively important.

    Idea is to remove driver.xxx from tests

    Huge number of different ways to do this - we will explore the following basics in these tutorials:

        - Basic Objects
        - Extends LoadableComponent
        - Page Factory

    Modelling decisions are required when you make a call on how to do this.

    Main Ideas:

    - Convert local abstractions to Page abstractions (i.e. get the driver.xxx out of the test)
    - Replace comments with abstractions (that make sense and are readable!)
    - Make decisions about the model based on the test readability and method re-use
    - Build only what you need as you need it

    Tips:

    Anytime you have an AND in your method name, split it! It will aid with re-usability!
