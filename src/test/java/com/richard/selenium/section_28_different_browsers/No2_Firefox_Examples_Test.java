    Firefox examples:

    We can control the preferences for firefox...

    How do we know the preferences? Well, in firefox, if you type in about:config in the search bar, you will see a
    list of preferences (see image in the readme).

    In terms of what they relate to, although a really outdated website - this is quite useful - this will tell you
    what the preferences actually relate to: http://preferential.mozdev.org/preferences.html

    We also have this - https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/FirefoxDriver
