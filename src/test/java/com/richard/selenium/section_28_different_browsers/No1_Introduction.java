    For an overview on browsers / drivers, see the readme - i have added some self-explanatory images in there :-)

    Basically, different browsers have different drivers + there are ways in which you can control them e.g. using
    profiles, specifying desired capabilities etc

    1 thing (also mentioned in the readme):

    When using RemoteWebDriver, we have to tell the remote web driver "i want you to give me a webdriver with these
    capabilities".
